# Update to the latest template

To pull upstream template changes into your project, run:

```bash
copier update
```

This fetches the latest version of the template and applies any changes to your
working copy, prompting for answers again with your previous answers as defaults.

All changes are staged but not committed — there may be merge conflicts to fix
first. Find them with:

```bash
git diff --check
```

Once all conflicts are resolved, commit the result.

## Recommended workflow

1. Ensure your project is clean and tests pass:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   tox -p
   ```
2. Commit or stash any outstanding changes
3. Run the update:
   ```bash
   copier update
   ```
4. Fix any merge conflicts
5. Verify the project still works:
   ```bash
   tox -p
   ```
6. Commit the update
