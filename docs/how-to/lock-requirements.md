# Manage the lockfile

## Overview

This project uses a `uv.lock` file to pin all dependencies to known-good
versions. CI tests run against these pinned versions (`uv run --locked tox`),
ensuring reproducibility across machines and time.

## Specifying dependencies

Dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml`:

- **Runtime**: `[project] dependencies`
- **Development**: `[dependency-groups] dev`
- **Extras**: `[project.optional-dependencies]` (e.g. `docs`, `test`)

Use minimum version constraints (`sphinx>=9`) rather than upper bounds. Only add
an upper bound if an upstream release breaks your code.

## Updating the lockfile

After editing `pyproject.toml`, regenerate the lockfile:

```bash
uv sync
```

This updates `uv.lock` and refreshes your local virtual environment without
upgrading other existing dependencies. The `uv-sync` pre-commit hook runs this
automatically on every commit that touches `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock`.

To upgrade **all** dependencies to their latest compatible versions:

```bash
uv sync --upgrade
```

Renovate (when enabled) runs this automatically once a week via the
`lockFileMaintenance` setting.

## Verifying reproducibility

To confirm your environment exactly matches the lockfile:

```bash
uv sync --locked
```

This fails if `uv.lock` is out of date, ensuring your local environment and CI
agree on every dependency version.
