# Contribute

Contributions are welcome. The repository root includes a `CONTRIBUTING.md`
file with the full project workflow; this page summarizes the most common
steps for day-to-day development.

## Start from a local checkout

Create a branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b my-change main
```

## Install the local development hooks

If you want checks to run automatically when you commit:

```bash
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

## Run the validation suite

Before opening a pull request, run the generated project checks locally:

```bash
tox
```

If you only want the main development environments:

```bash
tox run -e py312,lint,type-checking,check-packaging,docs
```

## Open a pull request

Push your branch, open a pull request against `main`, and describe the change,
its motivation, and any related issue numbers.
