# Make a release

To publish a new release of `python-template-example`:

1. Choose a version number following [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/)
   (e.g. `1.0.0` for a stable release, `1.0.0rc1` for a release candidate)
2. Go to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/adrien-berchet/python-template-example/releases)
3. Click **Draft a new release**
4. Click **Choose a tag**, type the version number (e.g. `1.0.0`), and click
   **Create new tag: 1.0.0 on publish**
5. Click **Generate release notes**, review and edit the notes
6. For pre-releases (alpha/beta/rc), check **Set as a pre-release**
7. Click **Publish release**

The CI pipeline will automatically:

- Build the sdist and wheel
- Publish the package to PyPI via OIDC trusted publishing
- Attach the built artifacts to the GitHub Release

## Pre-releases

Tags containing `a`, `b`, or `rc` (e.g. `1.0.0a1`, `1.0.0rc1`) are
automatically marked as pre-releases in GitHub Releases and on PyPI.
